# Hi there, I’m Xin Deng 👋 

### Welcome to my page!

I am currently a **Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [**Earth and Planets Laboratory, Carnegie Institution for Science**](https://carnegiescience.edu/epl), where I investigate the physical and chemical behavior of planetary materials under extreme conditions using *ab initio* and machine-learning-based atomistic simulations. My research aims to understand how Earth and other rocky planets formed, differentiated, and evolved through time.

Before joining Carnegie, I earned my **Ph.D. in Geophysics** in 2024 from the School of Earth and Space Sciences, **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)** under Prof. Zhongqing Wu, where I studied the elasticity and isotope fractionation of deep-mantle minerals using *ab initio* calculations. I also completed my **B.S. in Geophysics** in 2019 at the School of the Gifted Young, **USTC**, where I developed a lasting fascination with the hidden physics and chemistry that govern planetary evolution.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to [reach out](mailto:xdeng@carnegiescience.edu) if you’d like to chat about deep Earth, planetary evolution, or ideas for collaboration!
