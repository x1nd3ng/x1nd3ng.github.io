**Welcome to my page!** <br>

I am currently a **Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [**Earth and Planets Laboratory, Carnegie Institution for Science**](https://carnegiescience.edu/epl), where I investigate the physical and chemical behavior of planetary materials under extreme conditions using *ab initio* and machine-learning-based atomistic simulations. My research aims to understand how Earth and other rocky planets formed, differentiated, and evolved through time.

Before joining Carnegie, I earned my Ph.D. in Geophysics from the School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) under Prof. Zhongqing Wu, where I studied the elasticity and isotope fractionation of deep-mantle minerals using *ab initio* calculations. I also completed my B.S. at the School of the Gifted Young, USTC, where I developed a lasting fascination with the physics and chemistry of Earth’s interior.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat about deep Earth, planetary evolution, or ideas for collaboration!
